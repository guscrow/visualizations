    <h1>Good vs. Bad Visualizations</h1>
    <p>The first graphic that I am presenting and will be analyzing is from http://www.people-press.org</b>
    in an article titled “Continued Bipartisan Support for Expanded Background Checks on Gun Sales”.</b> 
    The second being a visualization of population from 1950-2060.</p>

    <p>In the visualization you can maybe say that it is functional, being that it does display the information in a way that is easy to read and understand. You can also say that it is insightful because of the fact that it reveals information that you may have not seen before or that could be hard to find. 
    </b>However, unless you are being told that support for gun control is decreasing, then this visualization doesn’t enlighten you or change your mind in any way. In addition to this, it is difficult to decide whether this visualization is truthful. This doubt stems from the designer leaving out the year 2014. This visualization shows information from two points in the year 2013, then skips 2014, and shows a different month in 2015. 
    </b>If they wanted to make it seem more truthful the designer should have picked the same month from 2013, 2014, and 2015. This change would show the difference in gun control support over a three-year span, using data from the same time period in each year.</p>

    <p>This example uses five-year increments in order to display their data, and x and y axis that are appropriate. These design choices in addition to putting their source at the bottom shows that this is a truthful visualization. 
    </b>It is functional because it gets its message across, as time passes the population of each generation will start to round out. This graphic’s simplicity and functionality is what makes it beautiful. 
    </b>It is also its simplicity in the data that it is showing that insights and enlightens. All this graphic shows </b>
    is the population of different generations, which would make the reader, or person seeing this graphic, be able to use this information to apply to any number of questions, and present questions to the reader.</p>
